# duraPET
Version: 0.0.1 - There Is Nothing

A virtual, evolving pet simulator created for [Procedural Generation Jam](http://itch.io/jam/procjam) 2015. Made with [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/).

Do you like pets? Do you like virtual pet simulators? Do you also like creatures that evolve over time? Well, a duraPET sounds just like what you need!

Feed your pet. Watch it grow. Don't feed your pet. Watch it start hating you. ...Or maybe it'll die. Who knows? You are the master of your pet. Determine its life.

## Installation Instructions
<!--Available for Windows XP and up as well as Mac OSX 10.6+. If you have any problems, please contact me on my twitter or put a comment on this page below.

### Windows Users
The .exe should work right out of the box.

### Mac Users
The software will say that it's made by an unknown developer. If you're an administrative user, you can right-click the app, click "open", and it should prompt again, but this time there's an option to "open it anyway". And now it should work!

If you're not an admin... get your admin to open the app for you.

### Ubuntu Linux Users

Please install [LOVE2D](http://love2d.org). Download from the PPA - it'll be in that link. Then, run the program with this command:

    love duraPET.love

### Any Other User
You'll need to build LOVE2D from source, so go to [LÖVE2D's build instructions page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Building_L%C3%96VE) to do so. From that point, you'll want to enter this command on the command line:

    love duraPET.love
-->
If you have LÖVE2D installed on your computer, you can run the code by typing on the command line

    love procjam-2015/duraPET/
